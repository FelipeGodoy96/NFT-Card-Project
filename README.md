## Overview

### The Challenge

Build the project to look as close as possible to the final visualization of the challenge.

Users should be able to:

- Visualize the ideal layout depending on the device's screen size (responsive design);
- Visualize the state of focus for interactive elements (hover transition).

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- SCSS
- Bootstrap


### What I learned

I improved my knowledge and practice with the use of SASS and Bootstrap, combining the use of variables and classes respectively.
In the previous project, using only CSS and HTML, it took me 3x longer compared to this one, showing that the tools, libraries and frameworks available make the developer's job easier.  

### Resources

- [Bootstrap 5.1](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/) - The basics of Bootstrap.
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/guide) - CSS Postprocessor.
